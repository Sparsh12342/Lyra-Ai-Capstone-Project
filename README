All files apart from FINAL.py are predecessors and have all been combined into one file, FINAL.py. 
This project takes a song from Youtube and extracts its transcript. This transcript is then translated and converted to an audio file.
The user also uploads an mp3 of their desired song that will be used to separate the vocals from the instrumentals using the demucs model. 
The audio file is synchronized with the vocals of the original song and then recombined after with the original instrumental. 

Running this file is as simple as running FINAL.py and following prompts.
**Packages such as numpy, demucs, soundfile, librosa, etc will be necessary.
